This is the README file for "List Mode Tomography from Muon Shadows"

Version: LMT4LUIS 1.0.

LMT4LUIS implements a procedure for estimating the difference between
a nominal density profile and an unknown target density profile. The
procedure uses detected cosmic ray muons that have passed through the
unknown density as its source of information.  It uses background runs
to characterize relevant features of the incident flux, detector
efficiency and the nominal profile simultaneously.

=========================== List of files ==============================

README               This file

guide.tex            LaTeX source for description of software and data

Makefile             Build instructions for gnu make program

geometryLM.py        Basic algorithms

GUILM.py             Graphical user interface for geometryLM.py.  Uses Tkinter

amf.c                Key operations coded in C for speed

setup.py             Instructions for compiling amf.c and making
                     library accessible from Python

tmp/AG_rotated.mat   **MISSING**

LMTMT.tex            LaTeX source for paper published in SIIMS

=========================== Installation and Use ============================

Given a distribution file named 'lmt4luis.tar.bz2', issue the
following sequence of commands.  (prompt assumed to be '>')

>tar -xjf lmt4luis.tar.bz2
>python setup.py
>ln -s build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.6/amf.so amf.so
>python GUILM.py

The four commands above will start a GUI for simulating muonic
examination of a sphere.  You may need to modify the 'ln' command if
your system is not lib.linux-x86_64-2.6.

>python GULM.py data

The above command will start a GUI for analyzing the experimental data
in tmp/AG_rotated.mat

>make LMTMT.pdf
>make guide.pdf

The above commands will build the two documents.  Building LMTMT.pdf
requires several hours on a PC with 8GB of RAM, and is not possible
with less RAM.
